# React-Challenge-7
Fetch and Display from an API


In this React challenge, we will make an API request to a third party API service. This is an open API. Hence, it requires no authentication.

For this challenge, you will utilize an open Game of Thrones API to fetch and display all the 12 Game of Thrones books alongside individual details of each book.
